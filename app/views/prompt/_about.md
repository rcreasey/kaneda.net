# About Me

## The Site

Contrary to what most of you might think, this site has nothing to do with what you came here to find.

It has nothing to do with [this movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094625/), [this math professor](http://math.uci.edu/~mkaneda/) or even [the dog](http://kaneda.com).

Remember when the intar-web was nothing more than a few bbs tied loosely together and the first time you dialed up your old analog modem? Well, being indecisive and just seeing [Shogun](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080274/), I asked a japanese friend of mine for a common japanese name. "I have a brother named 'Kaneda'," he offered. I've been typing 'kaneda' at login prompts ever since.

However, it wasn't until my sophomore year in college that I finally decided to get a webpage, and luckily the domain wasn't squatted (well, if you want to call the $75 domain registration those pirates over at NetSol were charging). As of Feb 2007, kaneda.net is eight years old and has now sprung up into many different aspects.

## Ryan C. Creasey

I'm a graduate of [UC Irvine](http://www.uci.edu) majoring in Information and Computer Science, with a specialization in Networks and Distributed Systems.

I'm employed as a Senior Systems Engineer II for the [battle.net](http://battle.net) team at [Blizzard Entertainment](http://blizzard.com). I'm not able to disclose much about my current role, but it's a pretty awesome gig.  You can check out [my LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/ryancreasey), if you're really that interested in my current or previous employment.

I'm married to my beautiful wife, Michelle, and together we have a miniature pinscher, Mr. T.

## The Site

This site has seen several iterations, some more painful and hollow than others, but hopefully this time I'll have gotten it right. Besides, what is more eternal than a stylized [zsh-esque](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) command prompt?  It's currently an extremely light [padrino](http://www.padrinorb.com/) application hosted on [heroku](http://heroku.com).  If you want to see the source code for this site, check out its [github page](https://github.com/rcreasey/kaneda.net).

This site is currently running on [heroku.com](http://heroku.com) on a [cedar](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cedar) stack.

[kaneda.net](http://kaneda.net) is the personal site of Ryan Creasey. There's not a whole lot to see here, other than random technical blatherings and comments about being a nerd.  If you want to see some of the code I've written, check out [my github page](https://github.com/rcreasey).
